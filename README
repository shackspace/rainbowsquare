== Getting Started

1. Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and configure the database connections (you need a MySQL server)

2. Create the databases: rake db:create:all

3. Migrate the tables with 'rake db:migrate' and run 'rake bootstrap:all' to create some default data

4. Start the web server:
       <tt>rails server</tt> (run with --help for options)

5. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3000/ and login with email "admin@test.com" and password "admin123"
